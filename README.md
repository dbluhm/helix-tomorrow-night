# tomorrow-night.vim

A tomorrow night theme created for use with [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/).

## Usage

Download the `tomorrow-night.toml` file and place in your `~/.config/helix/themes` directory.

## Tomorrow Theme

The [Tomorrow Theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) is a beautiful precursor to [Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) created by [Chris Kempson](https://github.com/chriskempson/).

I should aslo give credit to [squarefrog for their tomorrow-night variant](https://github.com/squarefrog/tomorrow-night.vim). I have shamelessly borrowed their README and reworded to suit my needs.

## License

This project is based on [Tomorrow Theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) which remains the copyright of [Chris Kempson](https://github.com/chriskempson/). The original project was released under the MIT license, and this one follows suit.

## Contributing

In the unlikely event you want to contribute to this colour scheme, I recommend you implement the changes in the [original project](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme).
